# Hero Level Classifier Report

## Introduction
The purpose of this code is to create a hero level classifier based on the provided experience points (XP). The program prompts the user for the hero's name and XP, utilizes a decision structure to determine the hero's level, and then displays a message indicating the hero's name and level.

## Methods
The implemented code employs variables, operators, conditional statements, and user input to achieve its objective. A decision structure is utilized to classify the hero's level based on the provided XP.

## Results
Upon entering the hero's name and XP, the code classifies the hero into one of several levels, including Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Ascendant, Immortal, or Radiant. The final output is a message displaying the hero's name and corresponding level.

## Conclusion
The code provides a simple yet effective solution for categorizing heroes based on their XP. It demonstrates the application of fundamental programming concepts such as variables, operators, and conditional statements. The modular design allows for easy modifications or extensions to accommodate additional hero levels or criteria.

## Case Study
Consider the case of two heroes, "HeroA" and "HeroB." HeroA has an XP of 3500, while HeroB has an XP of 8000. Running the code with these inputs results in the following output:

```javascript
// Example with HeroA
// Input:
// HeroA
// 3500
// Output:
// The hero named HeroA is at the Silver level

// Example with HeroB
// Input:
// HeroB
// 8000
// Output:
// The hero named HeroB is at the Platinum level
